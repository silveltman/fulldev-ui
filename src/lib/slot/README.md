# Block Components Guidelines
When creating slot components, follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and code quality in our repository:

- Slots are used as default slot values
- These slots are generally used the way they are, but because they are props they can easiliy be replaced if needed
- Slots always have a 'content' prop
